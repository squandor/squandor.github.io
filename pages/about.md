My name is Sander Schins. I've been programming in python for a couple of years now and more and more i see different examples and pieces of codes 
at different places. The reason why i started this was at first i like to teach and be helpfull to others when it comes to learning and understanding python 
and second i always missed one central point where you can find practical instructions on different projects where modules are used and how to use them. 
Yes there are standard docs on the internet but to be honest you will always gather different samples from different places to get to the place where you like you're own program.
