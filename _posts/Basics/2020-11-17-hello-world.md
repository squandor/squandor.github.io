When i started this project i thought well with which example shall i start. 
Ofcourse when you start with an programming language you start with an "Hello World"

I am not saying that how i code is the best way but i will try to explain the steps i make and show you how i program with python. 

When you start with python and are looking for basics i suppose that you already installed python on you're system. 

As first, to let python return some type of data you use the function "print"

To show the example "Hello World" you can use the following basic code:
{% highlight python %}
print("Hello World")
{% endhighlight %}

To use this code you can create an file named hello.py 

Inside you can put any code you want to run with python like the above given example. 

So if you run this python script with: python hello.py it will return:
{% highlight python %}
Hello World
{% endhighlight %}
